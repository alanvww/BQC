Overview

In Fall 2023, I initiated this project by inquiring with the IT department about any volunteer UX projects available for me to work on. I took the lead on the redesign project and invited my friends to join me. Under the supervision of two senior technologists, as well as developers Scott and Lenin, along with the NYU Digital Accessibility team, our goal is to create a better digital experience.
